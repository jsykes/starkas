Action space shooter game created with the Nintendo DS Homebrew Kit.

This project was originally made in 2010 for a college project.

Hopefully this project can help other people struggling with DS homebrew.

The manuscript can help you setup your machine and most testing was done with a DS Emulator on the .nds rom file.

I used a M3DS Real cart to build on device (Nintendo DS Lite)

Happy coding!?
